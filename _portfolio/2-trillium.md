In outer space, ionizing radiation can cause electronics to malfunction. Individual bits can become “latched-up” or “flipped”, meaning that the state of the bit can be frozen, or incorrectly set. This results in corrupted memory. While radiation-hardened components are commercially available, they are extremely expensive. On the Command and Data Handling team at UBC Orbit, I lead the development Trillium: a low-cost alternative to radiation hardened memory. Instead of aiming the negate the effects of radiation, Trillium aims to detect the errors induced by radiation, and counteract them. When a malfunctioning bit is detected, the system is correspondingly corrected.
