I competed in the UBC Engineering Physics Robot Competition over the summer of 2016. My team designed and built a fully automated robot that picked up “passengers” and dropped them off at a specific location. Our robot operated with a custom heavy duty version of a Arduino board (TINAH) o CPU AI for path correction, locating passengers, navigating obstacles (walls, opposing robot), optimized map navigation emphasizing speed and efficiency. We hand soldered circuits for sensing specific IR frequencies, driving and arm functionality.
 
Below is a video of our robot utilizing IR sensors to pick up the passenger and detect objects then navigating to the N-Zone area for drop-off:
