I created this repository because I had a task that could be optimized with code. My boss for the promotion company I'm part of  wanted me to log all the guests/reservations for the past year in a google sheet for storage and analytics purposes. Instead of going through the site and manually copying and pasting every detail into the shared google sheet, I made a python project that would do this autonomously. 

While doing this project I learned how to use the beautiful soup and selenium python packages. Both are very useful for interacting with websites.
