Communications Data Handling Team
- Satellite data management focused
   - Researching space resilient memory (NAND/NOR Flash, MRAM)
- Transfer of information between components of the satellite 

Trillium
- Design and implementation of “Trillium” project, low cost alternative to radiation hardened microcontrollers for space through the use of triple redundant STM32f401 microcontrollers 
   - Started at the drawing board in September and successfully tested a prototype under proton beam at TRIUMF facility in late November 
   - Prototype successfully corrects for single event upset bit errors and latch-ups 
   - STM micro controllers are flashed with C firmware
