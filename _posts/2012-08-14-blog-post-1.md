My name is Basil Wong and there are two sides of me. 

A qucik summary of my professional side would be(pulled directly from my LinkedIn Bio):

Interested in building things via software and physics. Loves working in teams, always looking to learn.

There's also the side of me that's not defined by my career:

I am 22 as of writing this post, I am the oldest of three brothers and I grew up in Vancouver. I love my parents, my Mom gives us compassion and the ability to appriciate, my Dad is our hero who inspires us to strive for our dreams. My brothers are my best friends who keep me on my toes.
