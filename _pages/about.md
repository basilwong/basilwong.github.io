To start, I'd like to thank you for coming. I essentially made this website for displaying my (limited) feats to potential employers, but it also serves as a journal for myself. 

Interested in building things via software and physics. Loves working in teams, always looking to learn.

At the top you will see 3 catagories, feel free to check them out:

 * CV: Expanded version of my resume. Resumes I'e handed or sent out are curated, so here's the full description of my experience/qualifications. 
 
 * Portfolio: My personal projects that I think are really cool. 
 
 * About Me: Kind of a blog series about my life outside of tech.
