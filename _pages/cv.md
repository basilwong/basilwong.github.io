**Meta – Software Engineer, Machine Learning – (January 2022 - Present)**
  * Responsible for implementing and testing training optimization techniques which led to 5:1 sparse feature embedding table compression ratio and 75% [activation memory cost reduction](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/commit/7b2af25f80071440538d8bf4de1804bb1f4914b5) for the Meta [GEM](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/ai-innovation-in-metas-ads-ranking-driving-advertiser-performance) model(which increased ad conversions by up to 5% in 2024)
  * Led the research eﬀort to determine how to generate synthetic, diﬀerentially private user data. Experimenting with both [marginal algorithms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12677) and [CTGAN models](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/254ed7d2de3b23ab10936522dd547b78-Paper.pdf), unblocked measurement of estimated 4.03% incremental revenue (Python)
  * Developed a new metric for Ads ML model evaluation which provides probability of conversion based on ML models trained on opt in data. The metric is now used to compensate for the signal loss caused by Apple Tracking Transparency. Accounts for 15 percent of all ads traffic in the experiment environment.
